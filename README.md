THIS ACTION IS DEPRECATED. Use the [SAF Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/saf-cli-action) instead.

GitHub Action for [Heimdall Tools](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall_tools)

Easily convert supported formats to Heimdall Data Format for use with Heimdall Enterprise Server, Heimdall Lite, or any other HDF-compatible viewer.


## Input and Output Arguments
### Input
#### `file-to-convert` (Required)

Filename of the file to convert available in the current directory of the action.

#### `converter` (Required)

One of the available converters from Heimdall Tools.

* `fortify_mapper`
* `zap_mapper`
* `burpsuite_mapper`
* `nessus_mapper`
* `snyk_mapper`
* `nikto_mapper`
* `xccdf_results_mapper`
* `jfrog_xray_mapper`
* `dbprotect_mapper`
* `netsparker_mapper`
* `sarif_mapper`
* `scoutsuite_mapper`

### Output

The action will output the converted HDF in the format `heimdall_<converter>.json`. Basic configuration (see the Example section below) would be to consume this file as an output of the GitHub action run.

## Secrets

This action does not use any GitHub secrets at this time.

## Environment Variables

Internally, the action's entrypoint uses the environment variables passed via action inputs. GitHub converts inputs to environment variables by prefixing them with `INPUT_`. Examples: `INPUT_FILE` and `INPUT_CONVERTER`.

## Example

Below is an example action. The idea is that a previous action would have generated the Nikto output (in this case, `nikto.json`) and the Heimdall Tools action will follow up and convert `nikto.json` to `heimdall_nikto.json` in HDF for use with Heimdall Enterprise server or Heimdall Lite.
